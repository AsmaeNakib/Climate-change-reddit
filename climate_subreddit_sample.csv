climatechange,"Please get the word out people, nuclear power is not our enemy in this fight against climate change. It is one of our most significant, and yet neglected, allies.","I come from a background in nuclear power. I am invested in nuclear power. I have been around it for the past 15 years. We need to update our sentiment towards it. Overall it is one of the safest forms of energy out there. It is clean, reliable, and getting cheaper. [Especially with the advent of reactors from companies like Oklo for example, that can use recycled Uranium waste as fuel, waste becomes less of a problem.](https://oklo.com/fuel-recycling/default.aspx)Have you ever had a run in with this massive amount of nuclear waste that skeptics talk about? Me neither. It goes unnoticed, and it will continue to go unnoticed because it is really a non-factor.

While I agree that a world powered strictly from renewable energy is a good north star or ideal destination, we are not there yet, and while technology advances in the industries of wind and solar, so too does global demand for energy. Nuclear power to me is the perfect source of energy that can fill the gap between where we are right now with renewables and where we need to be in order to meet demand. The beautiful thing about nuclear power. You don't need wind or sunshine for it to work. It doesn't sleep. It just keeps powering and powering. Eventually we may even achieve fusion, but research and progress requires a positive sentiment.

If you don't know much about it, that's okay! I would urge you to research it, and question your biases, and help friends question theirs. I want to put a stopper in greenhouse gas emissions as much as anyone else and reverse climate change. Let's use the tools that we have at our disposal. And if it weren‚Äôt for nuclear power Mark Watney would have never made it back to Earth. End rant.

>If a major portion of the ice sheet were to collapse, it could result in a sudden sea level rise of over 10 inches. This scenario poses a severe risk to coastal communities around the world, threatening livelihoods and infrastructure....

>In the realm of climate science, artificial intelligence is becoming a pivotal tool. Researchers are harnessing machine learning models to better predict when and where abrupt climate shifts might occur.

climatechange,I'm from South America and the situation is horrifying,"So... As is known, most of the southern hemisphere has been suffering with the effects of a heat dome lately. In my city by the end of this winter we were already reaching temps as high as 25-30¬∫C. **Yes, in WINTER.** Our winters are never very cold but here we'd usually have like 10-15 ¬∫C at this time of the year and temperatures above 30¬∫C are rare even in summer. Then spring started and this week we are reaching 34-38¬∫C. This is just the beginning of spring!

I feel like I'm going crazy because most people don't seem to be taking this as seriously as I am. Lots of news broadcasters seem to pin this on El Ni√±o alone, like it's just a random wheather anomaly that could have happened at any point. On the streets people just complain about he heat as if it was just a hot summer (it's not even summer folks!!!), and on the internet I barely see people talk about what is (to me) a very early preview of the more devastating effects of climate change.

My mind doesn't work very well in the heat so uh, right now it feels like I might never see a cold weather again and it's horrifying. Probably overreacting because of heat stress, but still. Perhaps I was not keeping up with the news about climate change, but I thought it would take a few more years before we would see something like this.

I am in the midst of finishing and moving to a house in a rural area where I plan to grow my own food forest, but I'm scared that this heat and possible droughts or excessive rain will make it already very difficult. I expected at least a few years of peaceful gardening and good crops. If the upcoming summer is hotter than it is right now though, I don't see how everything isn't going to just fry in the sun.

TL/DR is... I'm terrified about this heat wave and have no idea what to do to better prepare for the coming years (including mentally). I would appreciate any input or suggestions from people who have been thinking and researching more about climate change than I am. I'm not sure if I want to be one of the many climate migrants (though if I am, I suppose it would be better to be an early one) but damn if this isn't scary.

# **Corporate lobbying [xvi] legal organizations, lobbyists** [xviii]

By 1990, enterprising conservative and libertarian activists were wearing a path to Wichita to pitch their proposals to Charles Koch in hopes of his patronage. [178] In 1991, William ‚ÄúChip‚Äù Mellor, III, a former Reagan administration lawyer, proposed an aggressive, right-wing public interest law firm that would litigate against government regulations in favor of ‚Äúeconomic liberty‚Äù. [178] 

> Charles Koch said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do. I‚Äôll give you up to $500,000 a year for three years, each year, but you‚Äôll have to come back each year and demonstrate that you‚Äôve met these milestones that you‚Äôve set out to accomplish and I will evaluate it on a yearly basis, and there‚Äôs no guarantees.‚Äù [178] The legal group, the **Institute for Justice**, went on to bring numerous successful cases against government regulations, including campaign-finance laws, several of which reached the Supreme Court. [178]

## From 1998-2008, Koch Industries spent more than $50 million on lobbying. [1998-2008, 179]

Another member of the Koch network, Richard DeVos ($5.7 billion) [no date, 21], cofounder of Amway, Michigan-based MLM empire, led similar efforts to take political action and change laws after pleading guilty to defrauding the Canadian government (from 1965-1978 [285]) of $22 million in customs duties in 1982. [20]

In 1980, Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel, cofounders of Amway, became the top spenders on behalf of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs presidential candidacy. [285] By 1981, Richard DeVos was the finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), which Jay Van Andel headed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. [285]

Amway gave $2.5 million to the Republican Party during the 1994 midterm elections, which was the largest known soft money donation from a corporation in the country‚Äôs history. [287]

Richard Junior, known as Dick, married the other royal family of Michigan‚Äôs Dutch Reformed community, Betsy Prince, whose father, Edgar Prince, founded an auto parts manufacturing company that sold for $1.35 billion in cash in 1996, while her brother, Erik Prince, founded the global security firm Blackwater, which reporter Jeremy Scahill described as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most powerful mercenary army‚Äù. [287]
Betsy DeVos eventually became the chairwoman of Michigan‚Äôs Republican Party.

The DeVos family funded legal challenges to various campaign finance laws for years. In 1997, Betsy DeVos became a founding member of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a nonprofit organization whose only goal was to end all restrictions on money in politics. [288] Its honorary chairman was Senator Mitch McConnell, a savvy and prodigious fundraiser. [288] By designating itself a nonprofit charitable group, the Madison Center enabled the DeVos Family Foundation and other supporters to take tax deductions for subsidizing long-shot lawsuits that might never have been attempted otherwise. [289]

> Betsy DeVos wrote, ‚ÄúMy family is the largest single contributor of soft money [e.g. for ‚Äúissue‚Äù ads] to the national Republican Party ‚Ä¶ We do expect some things in return‚Äù. [289]

> As a Republican running for office in Kentucky in the 1970s, McConnell admitted, ‚Äú[A] spending edge is the only thing that gives a Republican a chance to compete‚Äù. [288] In a Senate debate on proposed campaign finance restrictions, McConnell repeatedly told colleagues, ‚ÄúIf we stop this thing, we can control the institution for the next 20 years‚Äù. [288]

# **Politically tinged nonprofit spending** [xvi] think tanks, academic programs, front groups [xviii] 

### Between 1998-2008, Charles Koch‚Äôs private fund, the **Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $48 million in tax-deductible grants, primarily to groups promoting his political views. [179] The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled by Charles and his wife Liz, with two company executives and an accountant, similarly made more than $28 million in tax-deductible grants. [179] David Koch‚Äôs fund, the **David H. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $120 million in tax-deductible grants - many to cultural and scientific projects rather than political. [179]
**Academic programs - the ‚Äúintellectual track within the DC-New York corridor‚Äù to influence elite opinion with op-ed pieces, lawsuits, and expert think tank studies** [235-236]

> Charles Koch wanted to focus on ‚Äúattracting youth‚Äù because ‚Äúthis is the only group that is open to a radically different social philosophy‚Äù [68] through educational indoctrination, with free-market curricula and even video games promoting his ideology pitched to prospects as young as grade school. [68]

> He believed that government interference in the economy was what had caused the last Great Depression. [210] ‚ÄúBankers, brokers and businessmen‚Äù had been falsely blamed. [210] The true culprits to him were Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, whom he regarded as dangerous liberals. [210]

> ‚ÄúHe advocated funding private institutes within prestigious universities, where influence over hiring decisions and other forms of control could be exerted by donors while hiding the radicalism of their aims. [69] ‚ÄúIt would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his political actions‚Äù [69]

> ‚ÄúIn order to alter the direction of America, they realized they would have to ‚Äúinfluence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia and think tanks‚Äù‚Äù [71] ‚ÄúCumulatively, the many-tentacled ideological machine they built came to be known as the Kochtopus‚Äù. [71]

By 1981, the Kochs‚Äô donations of $30 million largely funded the **Mercatus Center**, a think tank located on the George Mason University campus, a public university, advertised as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs premier university source for market-oriented ideas - bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems‚Äù. [182] 

Clayton Coppin, who taught history at George Mason and compiled Charles‚Äôs political activities for Bill Koch, characterized the Mercatus Center as ‚Äúa lobbying group disguised as a disinterested academic program‚Äù that enabled Charles to ‚Äúhave a tax deduction for financing a group, which for all practical purposes is a lobbying group for his corporate interest‚Äù. [183]

In the same building as the Mercatus Center was another heavily Koch-funded institute, chaired by Charles Koch, the Institute for Humane Studies. [183] Its founder had called taxes ‚Äútheft‚Äù, welfare ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù, and opposed court-ordered remedies to racial segregation. [183] The aim of the IHS was to cultivate and subsidize the next generation‚Äôs libertarian scholars. [183] 

### > Charles reportedly demanded better metrics with which to monitor students‚Äô political views. [183] To the dismay of some faculty members, applicants‚Äô essays had to be run through computers in order to count the number of times they mentioned the free-market icons Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman. [183] Students were tested at the beginning and the end of each week for ideological improvement. [183] The institute also housed the Charles G. Koch summer internship program, a paid fellowship placing students who shared the Kochs‚Äô views in like-minded nonprofit groups, where they could join the libertarian network. [183]

By 2004, the Wall Street Journal dubbed the **Mercatus Center** as ‚Äúthe most important think tank you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù and noted that 14 of the 23 regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ‚Äúhit list‚Äù had been suggested by Mercatus scholars. [186]

> Thomas McGarrity, a law professor at the University of Texas who specialized in environmental issues, argued that ‚ÄúKoch has been constantly in trouble with the EPA and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency‚Äù. [187] 

> One environmental lawyer who clashed repeatedly with the Mercatus Center dismissed it as a lobbying show dressed up as a nonprofit, calling it ‚Äúa means of laundering economic aims‚Äù. [187] The lawyer explained the strategy: ‚ÄúYou take the corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank,‚Äù which ‚Äúhires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders‚Äù. [187]

> For example, a top official at the Mercatus Center made a pro-smog argument that ‚Äúby blocking the sun, smog cut down on cases of skin cancer. She claimed that if pollution were controlled, it would cause up to 11,000 additional cases of skin cancer‚Äù. [187]
Wendy Gramm, wife of Senator Phil Gramm, head of Mercatus‚Äô Regulatory Studies Program, pushed for the Enron Loophole, exempting the type of energy derivatives from which Enron profited from regulatory oversight. [188] Senator Gramm crafted a deregulatory bill made to order for Enron and Koch, called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. [188] In 2001, Enron collapsed in a heap of bogus financial statements and fraudulent accounting practices. [188] But Wendy Gramm had pocketed up to $1.8 million from Enron the year after arguing for the loophole. [188] It emerged that before going under, Enron had made substantial campaign contributions to Senator Gramm, while its chairman, Kenneth Lay, had given money to the Mercatus Center. [188]

By 2008, **George Mason University** was both the largest single recipient of Koch funds for higher education and the largest research university in Virginia [189]

### In 1998, the American Petroleum Institute colluded with top oil executives and conservative think tank officials on a secret plan to spend $2 million to confuse the press and the public about the growing scientific consensus on global warming. [255] The plan called for recruiting skeptical scientists and training them in public relations so that they could act as spokesmen, thereby adding legitimacy and cover to the industry‚Äôs agenda. [255]

### Kert Davies, the director of research at Greenpeace, the liberal environmental group, spent months trying to trace the funds flowing into a web of nonprofit organizations and talking heads, all denying the reality of global warming as if working from the same script. [251] What he discovered was that from 2005-2008, a single source, the Kochs, poured almost $25 million into dozens of different organizations fighting climate reforms. [251] His research showed that Charles and David had outspent, by a factor of three, what was then the world‚Äôs largest public oil company, ExxonMobil [251] In a 2010 report, Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries the ‚Äúkingpin of climate science denial‚Äù. [251]

### The first peer-reviewed academic study on climate science denial by Robert Brulle, Drexel professor of sociology and environmental science, discovered that between 2003-2010, more than half a billion ($558 million) dollars had been spent on a massive ‚Äúcampaign to manipulate and mislead the public about the threat posed by climate change‚Äù, funded by 140 conservative foundations - in essence, a corporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-exempt philanthropic endeavor. [251]

### The money went to think tanks, advocacy groups, trade associations, other foundations, and academic and legal programs. [251]

### However, 3/4 of the funds for this ‚Äúclimate change counter-movement‚Äù were untraceable. [252] Brulle said, ‚ÄúPowerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global warming and raise public doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global threat. At the very least, American voters deserve to know who is behind these efforts.‚Äù [252]

### But by the time Obama took office, some had gone even more underground. Rather than funding directly, a growing number of conservative foundations and donors had begun directing their contributions through an organization called DonorsTrust. [253] Founded in 1999 by Whitney Ball, a West Virginia libertarian who had overseen development of the Koch-founded Cato Institute, it made contributions appear to go to a ‚Äúdonor-advised fund‚Äù rather than the more controversial groups she would later distribute the funds into. [253] This way, the donors‚Äô names were erased from the money trail - meanwhile, the donors retained the same if not bigger charitable tax deductions. [253]

A similar liberal donor-advised fund, the Tides Foundation, existed, but DonorsTrust as the conservative response soon had 4 times the funds and a far more strategic board. [253] Its directors consisted of the top officials of some of the most important organizations in the conservative movement, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Institute for Justice, the libertarian legal center whose start was funded by Charles Koch. [253]

In 2010, its single largest grant was $7.4 million to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFP), chaired by David Koch. [253] This grant was 40% of the AFP‚Äôs funding that year, belying the notion that it was a genuine grassroots organization. [253]

## Dr. James Baker, former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in 2005, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a better scientific consensus on [global warming] than on any issues I know - except maybe Newton‚Äôs second law of thermodynamics‚Äù. [255]

climateoffensive,The Amazon is burning and you're not Brazilian. Here's what you can do.,"I'll preface this by saying that, being Brazilian, I do understand your anger at my government's gross encouragement of ecocide and indigenous genocide. It is the same anger I and millions of other Brazilians feel every day, as much about what's being done with the rainforest as about what's being done with our lives: Bolsonaro has deregulated masses of agrotoxins and pesticides, effectively legalized a 7-day work-week, passed a pension reform that generally ensures we'll work until we die, presides over a massive police brutality spike in Rio de Janeiro and other cities, and is trying to close or privatize the public universities where millions of poor people study for free. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief on the web, Brazilians aren't benefitting from the Amazon being stripped off the earth (EDIT: and [a recent nationwide poll](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-49411984) shows that 96% are against deforesting and in favour of stronger regulation, and 89% want Congress to work towards zero deforesting). The only ones who benefit are the big landowners and land-grabbers who use the cleared ground for cattle ranching and soy plantations. These people have close to zero oversight on their earnings, holdings, and crimes. Brazil has never had a land reform; an almost colonial regime still holds in the countryside, and new forms of colonialism cast a shadow over our cities and politics. 

From 2003 to 2016, the country was governed by the centre-left Workers' Party - which, while disappointingly uncommitted to indigenous and rural causes, did see a reduction of deforestation rates from 28 000 km^2 a year in 2004 to 4 500 km^2 a year in 2012. It was removed in a soft coup, supported by the US and met with silence by the EU. The coup government, supported by the aforementioned landowners, ramped deforestation rates up to the 7 000 km^2 a year ballpark - as well as making life worse for everyone, leaving office with less than 5% approval. In last year's election, Lula, who was President from 2003 to 2010, was set to win a landslide over Bolsonaro - until an anti-corruption operation called Car Wash, [recently proven to be politically motivated](https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/), arrested him on dubious charges and did its best to isolate him from the electoral field. Once again, there are hints of US involvement, starting with the training of the judge responsible and coming to a foreign-funded fake news machine. Bolsonaro might apparently preside over a near 100% increase in deforestation rates, but his approval rates have quickly decayed. It is becoming increasingly obvious to the general population that he is leading us into one of the darkest periods of our history. It might be literally so, as smoke from the recent fires has even darkened S√£o Paulo's afternoon skies.

This is all to say that the proposed solutions of assassinating Bolsonaro, as a conspiracy theorist tried to do on the campaign trail, or going to war against Brazil, as advocated by [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/05/who-will-invade-brazil-to-save-the-amazon/), will only bring more strife into an already suffering country, and do nothing to halt the demise of the Amazon. But there are forms of international action that can.

**1) Sanction Brazilian beef, soy, and all activities of big landowners. Pressure for immediate land reform, as laid down in the 1988 Constitution.**

**2) Launch an international investigation and take to task those who have aided and abetted in the 2016 coup and in Lula's political prison.** That would likely include several current and former American government officials and judges, as well as oil executives and bankers.

**3) Show solidarity with Brazilian activists. Protest at embassies and foreign branches of BNDES. Take down your own fascist government.** Though there tends to be an international media blackout on Brazilian news that aren't related to the Amazon, we do see and listen to what is happening worldwide. Occupy a Brazilian embassy with a thousand people and we will take a million to the streets again. Topple one of the many fascists of today and we will be sure to adopt your tactics.",1608,140,1566366931.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/comments/ctcldq/the_amazon_is_burning_and_youre_not_brazilian/

Democratic states control 70% of U.S. GDP. This is our best leverage to push back against authoritarian overreach.

Call or email your Governor NOW‚Äîdemand they form a Blue-State Emergency Coalition.

MESSAGE TEMPLATE

Dear Governor,

I urge you to lead a coalition of Democratic Governors to counter the growing threat of federal overreach. Elon Musk has illegally seized Americans' social security numbers, now controls the U.S. Treasury payment system, and has dismantled the homeland protections that keep us safe from foreign threats. We are running out of time to protect our country from fascism at home and abroad.

We need a unified Blue-State Emergency Coalition to: Coordinate legal challenges to block unconstitutional federal actions. Declare a collective State of Emergency to protect state resources. Refuse cooperation with unlawful federal directives.

This is not about partisanship‚Äîit‚Äôs about defending democracy and economic stability. We must act within days or it will be too late. You have the power to make this happen. Will you take action?

I look forward to your response.

climateoffensive,"People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" are just as counterproductive to climate action as climate change deniers","  
The only real solution to climate change is to restore Earths climate to its pre-industrial state by removing CO2 from the atmosphere after all human activities have been made carbon neutral. We changed the Earths climate so therefore the solution is to change the Earths climate back to what it used to be before human activities changed it. The conservation of matter law conclusively disproves the idea that any environmental problem can truly be irreversible because it proves that matter can exist in any physical or chemical form at any time. 

Unfortunately, there are many people who cannot grasp this concept. Such people are the people who think that climate change is ""irreversible"". These sorts of people are seemingly incapable of thinking logically about climate change and devoid of problem solving skills. These sorts of people are profoundly ignorant towards the full picture of climate change. The profound ignorance of people who think climate change is ""irreversible"" is just like the profound ignorance of people who think climate change is ""a hoax"". Both types of people act against efforts to address climate change. 

Once all human activities have been made carbon neutral, these are the ideal carbon removal methods which can be used to return the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to 280 PPM 

\- Biochar 

\- Regenerative agriculture 

\- Enhanced Rock Weathering 

\- Turning biomass (ideally forest thinning waste) into fossil fuels and putting these fossil fuels back underground - [https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal](https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal) \- [https://recoal.net](https://recoal.net)  

\- Dissolving limestone in wastewater - [https://crewcarbon.com](https://crewcarbon.com) 

\- Killing and sinking harmful algae blooms - [https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/](https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/) 

\- Growing and sinking seaweed (seaweed can be farmed or natural) 

\- Producing carbon nanotubes from biogenic CO2 

People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" act as if these carbon removal methods do not exist. The fact is that these carbon removal methods do exist and have been proven effective by extensive research. The fault lies with people who hold the ""climate change is irreversible"" mindset. It is not there opponents (people like me who actually want climate change to be fixed) problem that they are incapable of understanding how carbon removal can be used to restore Earths climate. 

People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" should be treated the same way as people who think climate change is ""a hoax"". This stance on climate change should be considered just as counterproductive. We should put effort into actually fixing climate change instead of satisfying the emotional fetishes of those who cannot understand it.
