The full Executive Order is out! ⚠️ This is the biggest executive power grab in U.S. history. ⚠️,"🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨This Executive Order does the following:

❧ All federal agencies, including independent regulatory commissions, are now subject to direct White House control.

❧ Regulations cannot be issued without presidential approval.

❧ The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) can now withhold funding from independent agencies if they don’t align with White House priorities.

❧ All federal employees must follow the President’s and Attorney General’s interpretation of the law, eliminating legal independence.

❧ A White House Liaison is to be installed in every independent regulatory agency to enforce direct presidential control.

⚠️ This is the biggest executive power grab in U.S. history. ⚠️

This formally ends the concept of an “independent” regulatory agency, dismantling one of the last barriers to absolute executive power.

📍 This order effectively erases the last major restraints on executive power.
📍 The federal government no longer operates with checks and balances.
📍 Regulations and laws are now dictated solely by the President.
📍 If left unchecked, this is the moment the U.S. ceases to function as a democratic republic.

1️⃣ The President Now Controls All Regulatory Agencies

✅ The SEC, FTC, FCC, and FEC are no longer independent.

The Stock Market is now subject to White House control, enabling insider trading, favoritism, and targeting of political opponents.
Antitrust laws can be selectively enforced, allowing administration-friendly monopolies to expand unchecked.
Political opponents in the tech sector, media, or finance can be targeted with regulatory action while allies are protected.
Elections are now influenced by direct White House oversight of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

✅ The FDA, EPA, and consumer protection agencies are fully politicized.

Drug approvals, food safety regulations, and environmental policies can be rewritten for political or corporate interests.
Climate change regulations can be erased overnight.
Scientific research is now subject to White House approval before public release.

🚨 Implication: There is no longer any neutral enforcement of economic, environmental, or election laws. Everything is now dictated by political loyalty.

2️⃣ The White House Can Block Agency Budgets or Direct Funds Elsewhere

✅ The OMB can now adjust funding allocations for independent agencies.

This gives the President the power to defund agencies without needing Congress.
Regulatory agencies that challenge presidential policies will be quietly strangled of resources.
Agencies loyal to the President will receive full funding—even illegally.
🚨 Implication: Congress no longer controls federal spending on regulatory enforcement. The executive branch can choke out opposition agencies and reward allies.

3️⃣ The President & Attorney General Have Final Say on All Legal Interpretations
✅ All federal employees must follow White House interpretations of the law.

The Attorney General’s opinions override agency lawyers, inspectors general, and independent counsel.
Agencies cannot adopt their own interpretations of legal statutes—everything must align with the President’s views.
The President can rewrite federal legal interpretations overnight.
🚨 Implication: Legal consistency is gone. Agencies cannot push back against corrupt, illegal, or unconstitutional directives because the President’s interpretation is the only interpretation allowed.

4️⃣ Installing White House Liaisons in All Regulatory Agencies
✅ A “White House Liaison” will be placed in every independent agency.

This ensures constant presidential oversight of daily operations.
These liaisons will report agency actions back to the White House and enforce political compliance.
Agency directors will no longer have the ability to act without White House approval.

🚨 Implication: There is now a direct enforcement arm inside every regulatory body. Even agencies that resist presidential control will be internally monitored and controlled.

📍 Every regulatory body—from financial markets to environmental protections—is now politicized.
📍 Congress no longer controls federal funding—agencies must obey the White House or risk defunding.
📍 The President’s legal interpretations override all agency autonomy, eliminating independent enforcement of federal laws.
📍 The federal bureaucracy, once designed to be resistant to corruption, is now completely subject to presidential loyalty.",law,113471,14751,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/,climate change,"politics, news, "

"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.","I’m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I’ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can’t wait to answer your questions.

If you’re wondering what I’ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.

Melinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.

One of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.

**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I’d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I’ll answer as many as I can later on.

I am a 100 year old human and a World War 2 veteran. I want to share my life and experiences with people who might be helped by them. Ask me anything!,"Greetings!

As you may have imagined, the person typing and facilitating this AMA is not the 100 year old human, but his granddaughter, me!

A little bit about my grandpa: he grew up in Washington State, and has traveled quite a bit. He worked for the FDA for many years, some as an investigator, some as a pharmacist. He served in the air force during World War 2 as a photographer.

Clearly there's more to him than this, so ask him some questions!

Proof: [https://imgur.com/pFBHcWZ](https://imgur.com/pFBHcWZ)

&#x200B;

Y'all he is enjoying this so much! He's flabbergasted at how many people are asking questions and upvoting him, at first he thought it was all people I knew haha. He's so happy! We're gonna take a little break, some of my family just arrived for a visit.

4:14 PM ET: we're back! gonna knock out some more questions until I have to dip. Appreciate all the interest! Sorry he sometimes misunderstands some questions aha.

With a lot of these I'll ask him and he says 'let me think about that a bit' and I'll circle back and I guess he hasn't finished thinking about them - so sorry for those still waiting! lol

5:05 PM ET: So he's starting to fall asleep as I ask him questions, so I think we're gonna call it a day aha. He's in rehab for a broken hip right now, and a bit forgetful and confused at times, so hopefully that will give some explanation to some of the stranger answers he's said. Thank you so much for everyone who asked things and commented and told stories and thanked him, he is just so pleased!!! I'll go through this as I'm able and answer what I can from my perspective. Next time I visit him, I'll try to get a few more answered. He'll remember this for a long time. Thank you all, SO MUCH!!!

11/6/19 5:39 PM ET: Hi all! I stopped by my grandpa's current place today and asked and answered a few more questions! He gets tired pretty quickly, and tends to say ""I need to think about that"" for things that aren't direct (broad questions like ""meaning of life"" and such), so for further questions I would encourage more specific questions. I'll continue asking him things as we're able - there are a lot to go through, but I and we appreciate the interest so much - every time I update him about the number of upvotes, his face lights up :)

While we're here and this has so much visibility (wow), I've gotta put this out there, cause I'd really love to have the opportunity to live as long as my grandpa has: WE NEED CLIMATE ACTION!!! We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it's been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that. Links below for some organizations I like (but there are definitely others, so please, look them up and find one right for you!) (note: while my grandpa is not super hip about all the aspects of climate change, I have shared my life with him and he has been super supportive of me in my journey of action, and for that I am so grateful) JOIN, TAKE ACTION, SUPPORT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, AND/OR DONATE PLEASE, I WANT US ALL TO LIVE AS LONG AS MY GRANDPA <3

I think I'm done with Bill Nye. His new show sucks.,"I am about halfway through Bill Nye Saves the World, and I am completely disappointed. I've been a huge fan of Bill Bye since I was ten. Bill Nye the Science Guy was entertaining and educational. Bill Nye Saves the World is neither. In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn't properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.

I just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as ""only eating meat"" which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.

In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because ""nobody wants it."" Really? That's his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don't want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.

In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn't reduce the acidity level of a solution. He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time. How does vinegar treat an upset stomach? Does it actually work, or is it a placebo affect? Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don't know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn't change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits. So obviously there is some reasoning behind some alternative medicine and practices and to dismiss it all as a whole is stupid.

I just don't see the point of this show. It's just a big circle jerk. It's not going to convince anyone that they're wrong, and it's definitely not going to entertain anyone. It's basically just a very poor copy of Penn and Teller's BS! show, just with all intelligent thought removed.",television,86926,16163,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/6bi4ho/i_think_im_done_with_bill_nye_his_new_show_sucks/,climate change,Media

r/science Stands with the Paris Climate Agreement,"Hello everyone,

Earlier today [President Trump announced his intention to exit the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?). While r/science ~~does not take a stance on political issues~~ *generally strives not to take a political stance, this issue is so exceptional and is heavily science-related that we made an exception*. We feel the need to reaffirm our commitment to solid science, and in that regard we strongly disagree with these actions. [Climate change is real](https://climate.nasa.gov/) and it's happening right now. [There is still time left to do something about it](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm), but this requires the actions of all people of the world. 

We decided to create this thread to welcome discussion and questions from the users about climate change and the Paris Agreement. We will be moderating this thread [less heavily than we normally do](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules), but we still ask that you be civil and respectful in the comments.  Comments that go against established science must include **peer-reviewed** citations, and egregious dismissals may result in bans.

EDIT: Please note the edits above in italics. 

r/askscience is [also holding a megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ertms/askscience_megathread_climate_change/) on this issue.

"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and author of “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.” Ask Me Anything.","I’m excited to be here for my 9th AMA.

Since my last AMA, I’ve written a book called [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-new-climate-book-is-finally-here?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE). There’s been exciting progress in the more than 15 years that I’ve been learning about energy and climate change. What we need now is a plan that turns all this momentum into practical steps to achieve our big goals.

My book lays out exactly what that plan could look like. I’ve also created an organization called [Breakthrough Energy](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) to accelerate innovation at every step and push for policies that will speed up the clean energy transition. If you want to help, there are [ways everyone can get involved](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/What-you-can-do-to-fight-climate-change?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE).

When I wasn’t working on my book, I spent a lot time over the last year working with my colleagues at the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/our-story) and around the world on [ways to stop COVID-19](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-funding-additional-250-million-suzman). The scientific advances made in the last year are stunning, but so far we've fallen short on the vision of equitable access to vaccines for people in low-and middle-income countries. As we start the recovery from COVID-19, we need to take the hard-earned lessons from this tragedy and make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic.

I’ve already [answered a few questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9dwCfnzQr4) about two really important numbers. You can ask me some more about climate change, COVID-19, or anything else.

**Proof:** [https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1372974769306443784](https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1372974769306443784)

"President Trump has threatened national monuments, resumed Arctic drilling, and approved the Dakota Access pipeline. I’m an environmental lawyer taking him to court. AMA!","Greetings from [Earthjustice](http://earthjustice.org/), reddit!

Earthjustice is a public interest law firm that uses the power of the courts to safeguard Americans’ air, water, health, wild places, and wild species. 

We’re very busy. Donald Trump has tried to do more [harm to the environment](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/donald-trump-100-days-president-climate-change-global-warming-nature-catastrophic-dangerous-weird-a7701906.html) in his first 100 days than any other president in history. The New York Times recently published a list of [23 environmental rules](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/02/climate/environmental-rules-reversed-trump-100-days.html?_r=4) the Trump administration has attempted to roll back, including limits on greenhouse gas emissions, new standards for energy efficiency, and even a regulation that stopped coal companies from dumping untreated waste into mountain streams.  

Earthjustice has filed a steady stream of lawsuits against Trump. So far, we’ve filed or are preparing litigation to stop the administration from, among other things:

* gutting protections for 27 [national monuments](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/trump-puts-america-s-national-monuments-on-trial-with-latest-executive-order)

* resuming [coal mining](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/groups-filing-lawsuit-over-trump-s-order-to-open-thousands-of-acres-to-public-lands-coal-leasing) on public land

"Sydney, Australia: Local council retaliates after case of mass tree vandalism.","""...Council’s pursuit of justice steps up following the largest tree vandalism case in Lane Cove’s recent history taking place in Longueville last year.

In November 2023, more than 290 trees from a Threatened Ecological Community were illegally destroyed on the foreshore of Woodford Bay.

At the time Council chose not to immediately issue a penalty infringement notice, recognising the scale and seriousness of the offence warranted the exploration of criminal prosecution.

Following legal advice, Council began the process of pursuing the strongest possible penalty and since then the required standards of evidence and information has been carefully gathered. Council continues to liaise regularly with its legal team to assist in building a case before lodgement with the Court.

As part of its response, Council has been working to gain approval for the installation of a 7metre long and 2metre high banner to interrupt the harbour view of the property which would most benefit from the mass clearing of the trees. As the area is classified as a Threatened Ecological Community and contains some items of Aboriginal Heritage, it was important the appropriate approvals were in place before installing the signage. Having obtained approval from key stakeholders and following no objections from the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) installation of the banner structure started this week. (Artist impression pictured above).

Council staff have continued to monitor the health of the affected tree species, which included Eucalypts (incl. Angophora), Banksia and Casuarina to facilitate regeneration of the site.

The legal case and banner installation are important steps in our commitment to seeking the strongest possible recourse response to send a message that we stand tall against tree vandalism in Lane Cove....""
